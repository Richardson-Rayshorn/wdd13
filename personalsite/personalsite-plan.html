    <h3>About Autism</h3>

    <h4>What is Autism?</h4>
    <p>
      This means that people with Autism experience differences in the way they communicate and interact socially, 
      and their behaviour may be repetitive or highly focussed (the term ‘restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour’ 
      is often used to describe this). People with Autism also tend to experience differences with their senses that 
      can affect the way they feel about and respond to their surroundings. Autism is not a disease or illness.
      Autism is also known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ‘Spectrum’ refers to the wide range of characteristics, 
      skills, and abilities that different people with Autism have. No two people are affected by Autism in the same way. 
      Every person experience Autism differently and has different support needs. Although the core characteristics of Autism 
      can cause a range of challenges, it is important to recognise that they can also result in unique skills and capabilities.
      </p>

    <h4>How can you tell?</h4>
    <p>There are many signs that can indicate to you that a child, youth, or an adult may have autism. You can look at it through 
      the lenses such as: social communication, behaviors, and thinking and learning. A list of these will be listed along with a 
      questionnaire that shares a possibility rating.</p>

    <h3>Resources</h3>

    <h4>Resources</h4>
    <p>self-check to learn more about if your child has autism if you haven’t consulted a professional. Links to games and activities for autistic children. As they are redirected, they will need to submit personal information, this will be this way until we make the site more dynamic than static so that way, we can offer more resources to users.
      •	What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers? Since it is mainly a static site, we will not collect personal data other than the persons name and email if they submit one of our questionnaires. Note, they will be redirected to sites that offer training on autism for parents or communities. 
      •	Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? The website will be targeted to mainly parents in the Caribbean. There aren’t many resources available in the Caribbean so this will be a unique website for parents.
