    <p>Hello everyone, I am pursuing my degree Bsc in Applied Technology.
        I am currently running my own technology service business where I 
        offer a variety of IT services including Web Design and Development. 
        I am from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, an island in the 
        Caribbean.
    </p>
    <p>I love learning new technologies, watching funny videos on youtube,
        playing adventure games, and most of all seeing my son laugh.
    </p>
    <p>I have been married for 6 years. I enjoy spending time with my wife
        and son. He especially makes me laugh, he is on the autism spectrum
        so everything he does at least to me makes me smile.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church for 16 years. I was baptized in 2007
        I served a mission and now I am the Branch President. I look forward to
        getting to know you all and working with you in this course.
    </p>
